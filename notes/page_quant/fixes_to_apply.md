## FIXED: pgq_fixed F1 collapse — three stacked root causes (one real lesson)

- **Symptom:** pgq_fixed/pgq_fixed_ea F1 collapsed to ~0–14 (whitespace-only
  generations) across three successive fit configurations, while per-head proxies
  (top1 0.476, k_mse ~1.0, no NaN, sane norms) stayed unremarkable each time.
- **Diagnosis chain** (each stage verified with a targeted probe, not proxies):
  1. *Mid-rise grids have no zero level* → every near-zero coord inflates to ±s/2 →
     all key norms grow coherently → softmax corrupted network-wide. Ranking
     proxies are blind to uniform norm inflation. Fix: mid-tread symmetric grids
     (zero level), widths {0,2,4,8} (1-bit mid-tread is degenerate).
  2. *"Tail-safe" q999 scales are not safe for sinks*: attention-sink keys (tokens
     0–3, carrying 19–84% of realized mass per head) sit 2.7–5.4× BEYOND the
     per-coord 99.9% quantile, so every width clipped them equally → the
     Lagrangian saw no distortion gain from wider widths → assigned sinks w=0 →
     sink mass 0.84→0.007 → generation destroyed. Probe:
     `sink mass ref/fixed/ec = 0.843/0.007/0.836`. Fix: w4/w8 scales cover the
     per-head fit-data max |r| (recovered from the finest EC rung's alphabets;
     live-coord filtered, ratio clamped to 8).
  3. *Even covering 4-bit grids are too coarse for sinks and the Lagrangian
     rationally refuses to buy w8 at tight budgets* → forced w=8 for sequence
     positions 0–3 (position-based ⇒ decoder-derivable, zero sideband; page 0's
     budget pays; standard practice — KIVI keeps sinks high precision). After the
     fix: sink relerr 0.02–0.04, rate exactly 0.996.
- **The lesson (report-worthy):** entropy-coded deadzone quantizers get sink safety
  FOR FREE (unbounded calibration-range alphabets + zero bin). Fixed-width
  saturating grids must handle the zero level and the sink tail EXPLICITLY, and
  per-head reconstruction metrics + argmax proxies cannot detect either failure —
  both corrupt the softmax denominator, not the ranking.
- **Residual (known, not a bug):** at b=1.0 the width mix is eviction-heavy (~50%
  w0), which shrinks non-sink competitor logits and overshoots sink mass
  (0.84→0.96). Rate-regime property; judged by F1.
- **Verification:** unit tests 8/8; sink-gate probe PASS on relerr; F1 rerun3
  (sha post-patch) in flight; quarantined cells: `*__BROKEN_pre_scalefix`
  (MSE-fit mid-rise), `*__BROKEN_midrise` (q999 mid-rise), `*__BROKEN_stale`
  (pre-sink-fix).
